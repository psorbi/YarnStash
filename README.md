# YarnStash
I'm creating my own website to organize my knitting hobby

currently - creating yarn database and frontend design

eventually the plan is to also have a database of patterns and be able to compare the patterns to the available yarn to see possible pairings
other add ons include users with passwords and an archive of completed patterns
